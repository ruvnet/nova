# CAC Agent Implementation Details

## Overview

The Cohen's Agentic Conjecture (CAC) agent implements a dual-process cognitive architecture that combines neural network predictions (System 1) with symbolic reasoning (System 2) through a dynamic gating mechanism.

## Core Components

### 1. Neural Subsystem (System 1)
- Fast, pattern-based processing
- Confidence scoring based on input characteristics
- Lower confidence near decision boundaries
- Implementation: `core/neural.py`

```python
# Example usage
neural_system = NeuralSubsystem(config)
prediction, confidence = neural_system.predict(0.75)
```

### 2. Symbolic Subsystem (System 2)
- Rule-based logical reasoning
- Clear, explainable decision steps
- Configuration-driven rules
- Implementation: `core/symbolic.py`

```python
# Example usage
symbolic_system = SymbolicSubsystem(config)
prediction, reasoning = symbolic_system.reason(-0.5)
```

### 3. Gating Controller
- Dynamic system selection
- Confidence-based decision making
- Adaptive thresholding
- Implementation: `core/gating.py`

```python
# Example usage
gating = GatingController(config)
prediction, source, confidence = gating.decide(neural_output, symbolic_output)
```

## Runtime Configuration

The agent supports real-time configuration through the CLI:

```bash
# Basic prediction
cac predict --value 0.75

# Override confidence threshold
cac predict --value -0.5 --threshold 0.9

# Force specific system
cac predict --value 0.05 --force-system neural

# Detailed analysis
cac predict --value 0.75 --verbose
```

## Decision Making Process

1. Input Processing:
   - Neural system generates prediction and confidence
   - Symbolic system applies rules and generates reasoning

2. Gating Decision:
   - If confidence > threshold and predictions match: Use neural
   - If confidence < threshold: Use symbolic
   - If forced: Use specified system

3. Output Generation:
   ```json
   {
     "prediction": 1,
     "confidence": 0.75,
     "source": "neural",
     "neural_prediction": 1,
     "symbolic_prediction": 1,
     "reasoning": "Value 0.75 is non-negative therefore class 1"
   }
   ```

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration (config/agents.yaml)
```yaml
cac_agent:
  name: "CAC Agent"
  version: "1.0.0"
  systems:
    neural:
      confidence_threshold: 0.75
    symbolic:
      rules_file: "config/rules.yaml"
    gating:
      default_threshold: 0.75
      adaptation_rate: 0.1
```

### Rules Configuration (config/rules.yaml)
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "sign_rule"
    description: "Determine class based on sign of input"
    conditions:
      - "x < 0"
      - "class = 0"
      - "x >= 0"
      - "class = 1"
```

## Performance Characteristics

1. Neural System:
   - High confidence far from decision boundary
   - Lower confidence near boundary (Â±0.1)
   - Fast pattern recognition

2. Symbolic System:
   - Rule-based decisions
   - Clear reasoning steps
   - Consistent behavior

3. Gating Behavior:
   - Prefers neural system when confident
   - Falls back to symbolic when uncertain
   - Adapts threshold based on performance

## Usage Examples

### 1. High Confidence Case
```bash
$ cac predict --value 0.75 --verbose
# Uses neural system (high confidence, far from boundary)
```

### 2. Low Confidence Case
```bash
$ cac predict --value -0.05 --verbose
# Uses symbolic system (low confidence, near boundary)
```

### 3. System Testing
```bash
$ cac predict --value 0.05 --force-system neural
$ cac predict --value 0.05 --force-system symbolic
# Compare system behaviors
```

## Error Handling

1. Input Validation:
   - Numeric input validation
   - Threshold range checking (0.0 to 1.0)
   - System name validation

2. System Failures:
   - Neural system falls back to low confidence
   - Symbolic system provides error reasoning
   - Gating defaults to symbolic on errors

## Future Enhancements

1. Planned Features:
   - Batch processing support
   - Performance analysis tools
   - Rule management interface
   - Model training capabilities

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Additional gating strategies
   - Enhanced confidence metrics
   - Dynamic rule learning
   - System performance tracking

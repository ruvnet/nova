# Cohen's Agentic Conjecture (CAC) Agent

## Introduction

The Cohen's Agentic Conjecture (CAC) Agent is an innovative implementation of dual-process cognitive architecture that combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. This implementation bridges the gap between fast, intuitive decision-making and deliberate, rule-based reasoning, providing a robust framework for intelligent decision-making systems.

The agent demonstrates how two distinct cognitive processes can work together, with a dynamic gating mechanism that intelligently selects the most appropriate system based on confidence and context. This approach mirrors human cognitive processes, where we often rely on quick intuitions but can switch to careful reasoning when needed.
